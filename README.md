# Network-Packet-Distributor
A windows application for listening packets in promiscous mode or over UDP [layer 4] and distribute over configured IPs. 

Application is written in C# .net

Some of the features need a little work to sharpen the app.

It can listen the incoming traffic over the network interface of the user's choice.

It has following features:

1. Users can create multiple logins.
2. Listen both over IP and in promiscous modes.
3. Can create logs of incomig traffic.
4. Can Send recorded data and live data to upto 10 destinations.
5. Users can save and load different configurations.
6. Deep packet inspection.

User login screen appears first, just press "OK" without any input and you are good to go.
I added both the app and the source code.
